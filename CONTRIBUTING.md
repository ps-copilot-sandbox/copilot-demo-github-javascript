Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

- Suggest a creation of a new documentation or a resource

### Prerequisites to suggest a change to an existing documentation or a resource

- [ ] Did you make sure that you understand this suggestion improves the existing resource?

### Prerequisites to suggest a creation of a new documentation or a resource

- [ ] Did you already check there is not a similar example for what you are trying to do? Only after you say `yes`, please continue.
