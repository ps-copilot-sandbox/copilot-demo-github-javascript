## Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Make sure that you go through this checklist before making a new contribution. Your contribution can be either one of two categories:

- Suggest a change to an existing documentation or a resource, or
- Suggest a creation of a new documentation or a resource

### Prerequisites to suggest a change to an existing documentation or a resource

- [ ] Did you make sure that you understand this suggestion improves the existing resource?

### Prerequisites to suggest a creation of a new documentation or a resource

- [ ] Did you already check there is not a similar example for what you are trying to do? Only after you say `yes`, please continue.
- [ ] Does your contribution contain step-by-step instructions, not just code examples?
- [ ] Did you make sure that the instructions are repeatable and easily understandable by everyone?

If you went through all of these required steps, great! Please follow the instructions below to make a new contribution.
